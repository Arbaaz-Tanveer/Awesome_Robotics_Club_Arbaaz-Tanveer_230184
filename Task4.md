I am very interesreted in this gyro bot project because I know about PID controls and always wanted to implement it and see in action.I hope to learn how to write the control algorithm from scratch in this project and implement it in real hardware ,i also always wanted to use imu sensors so it will also help in that.Overall it will be a great learning experience.
